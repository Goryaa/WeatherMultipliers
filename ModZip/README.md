# Weather Multipliers

### Moons with active weather will contain scrap with higher value

Only the host needs the mod to set the scrap values.

## Multipliers

Current default values are:

- Rainy: 10%
- Foggy: 25%
- Stormy: 35%
- Flooded: 35%
- Eclipsed: 70%

## Config

Set your own multipliers!
After launching the game with the mod installed a WeatherMultipliers.cfg file will exist in your BepInEx/config folder.

## Known Issues

- When a player joins without the mod, they may not see the correct value for the apparatus. Normal scrap works though.

## TODO

- Add multiplier values on the weather terminal UI

## Manual Installation

Place the `WeatherMultipliers.dll` file in your `BepInEx/plugins` directory.
